 `Where To start from`
 
 # Pandas
 
 Pandas is used to explore data,analyse data,manipulate data.
 
 * We will learn how to manipulate the data given to us and how we are going to use it in creating our Machine Learning models.

# Numpy

It is the foundation of Machine Learning. What it actually does is converts the data into a series of numbers and then what a machine learning algorithm will do is workout patterns in these numbers.

# Matploylib

Visualizing our Data in a pictorial form to make it more appealing.

# Scikit Learn

Which model is best suited accourding to our workflow.

0. An end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow
1. Getting the data ready
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4. Evaluatimg a model
5. Improve a model
6. Save and load a trainined model
7. Putting it all together
